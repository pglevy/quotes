‘Consensus’ decision-making is too slow. We can’t wait until everyone is convinced before we act. Appian designates one decision-maker for each decision. (If for any decision it’s not clear who it is, clarify it.) Everyone can speak their mind, but when the decision is made we move together quickly. (If I’m the decision-maker, I’ll put my decision in writing — it helps for clarity.)
